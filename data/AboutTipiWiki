\"I wanted a small and simple Wiki for my personal website. I found nothing so i did my own.\" - AndreasZwinkau

That was three years ago. It got registered at Sourceforge 2003-09-06.

After some months of minor bug squashing and a complete rewrite to TipiWiki2 i put the project to sleep.

During this dark period there were some TipiWikiOffsprings and it even got integrated into the [http://webhosting.lycos.de/one-click-site/modules/tipiwiki_2.3/details/ services of a major webhoster].

In 2006 i needed a small and simple for my personal website again. I found nothing again so i revived my own. Thanks to it\'s great hackability i had it refreshed and up in one day.

Now i\'m tweaking it more and more and after this major overhaul i decided to release it again.
