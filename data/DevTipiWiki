How to handle revisions? Or better: How to handle old versions?

The current TipiWiki Release uses files with an appended date to save old versions. This hacked TipiWiki writes the different versions in the same file and thus, has to read all versions just to display the latest.

I fully and sadly agree. PHP is one reason why i don\'t want to make TipiWiki bigger and greater. 

= design decisions

== security

TipiWiki doesn\'t care much about security. The page directory needs to be write- and readable to the webserver.

There is nothing to secure. If you want to prevent some pages from being changed, you can take away the files write permission manually.

== revisions

TipiWiki *does* save old revisions of pages, but they are not accessable from the web.

Mostly because of spam it is necessary to save older revisions, but building them into the interface would make it twice as complicated. My solution is just to append new version to the page file and to extract the last page on each view.

== hackability

Don\'t like the markup language? Just edit the code, it\'s just a preg_replace. TipiWiki is (hopefully) very easy to hack and adjustable to your needs, if you\'re not afraid of PHP. This is partly lazyness on my side, partly to be nice to beginners.
