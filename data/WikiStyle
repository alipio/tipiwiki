TipiWiki tries to be as standard-compliant as possible or as far as there is a standard. So here are the commands to use here.
!! Text formatting
* One * before a line puts bullet in front of it, like in this bulleted list
* One ! is <h1> - a big headline
* Two !! is <h2> - smaller headline
* Three !!! is <h3> - smallest headline
* Two * before and after something makes it **bold**
* Two \' before and after something makes it \'\'italic\'\' 
* One vertical bar before and after something put a |box around|

Don\'t be afraid to click on edit, to see how this page is formatted
!! Links
* Normally you should use WikiWords, which are characterized by the lacking whitespace between. The will be made links to other pages in this Wiki.
* If you want to link to something external, you could  just type the url and if it is valid, it will be clickable
* to make external links more beautiful, there is another version [valid url|link] can be used to create something [http://slashdot.org|like that]
* another __new__ feature is picture linking. If you put the url to a picture between such [ ] brackets, the image will be displayed. For example the logo below
[http://tipiwiki.sourceforge.net/logo.png]
!! special pages
* RecentChanges could be every page just insert a \'\'< recentchanges >\'\' (without the whitespaces) and there the RecentChanges will be inserted
* FindPage is the same with < findpage >
* AllPages, too. < allpages > does the magic

!!Underlines
It is possible and implemented to format something as underlined with __ underscores. This will result in **invalid XHTML**. The <u> tag was deprecated, because people mistake underlined with links. Better you don\'t use it.
